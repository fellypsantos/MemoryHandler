# MemoryHandler

Class to read and write process memory. This file is the result of few days of studying about offline game hacking.

It's not wrong when you modify the game without affecting other players experience, like in offline games. The class use functions from kernel32.dll file to handle memory from a given process, generally a game but not restricted to that kind of use.
